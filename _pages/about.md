I am a 1st year PhD Student in Computer Science at Simon Fraser University supervised by [Dr. Linyi Li](https://cs.sfu.ca/~linyi/) in the [Trustworthy AI Lab](https://sfu-tai.github.io/).

My PhD research focuses on explaining deep learning models through the lens of their intrinsic structure and algorithms. The objective is to derive provable guarantees, thereby enhancing their interpretability and trustworthiness. This work is critical for the adoption of deep learning in high-stakes applications, where trust is vital for widespread acceptance.
